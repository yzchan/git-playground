# git reset

### 问题描述：

```text
Name: reset
Level: 21
Difficulty: **

There are two files to be committed.  The goal was to add each file as a separate commit, however both were added by accident.  Unstage the file `to_commit_second.rb` using the reset command (don't commit anything).
```

### git命令

```shell
git reset HEAD to_commit_second.rb
```
